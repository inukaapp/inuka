# inuka


This code allows the user to compile Inuka as an Android app using Apache Cordova (cordova.apache.org). 

The app contains books and interactive stories in English and Swahili. 

The books are taken from African Storybook (www.africanstorybook.org) and are distributed under Creative Commons license.

The book images and text are stored on a Google Drive link due to GitHub's restrictions on file size of uploads.

The Inuka app is released under MIT License, Copyright 2016 Pearson.
